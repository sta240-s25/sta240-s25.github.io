Let $X$ be a random variable, and let $g$ be some function. Because $X$ is random, the new variable $Y=g(X)$ is also random. Given what we know about $X$, what is the distribution of $Y$? This simple question will preoccupy us for the next seventy-five minutes.

## Problem -1: recall lecture

If $\Theta\sim\text{Unif}(-\pi/2,\,\pi/2)$, then what is the distribution of $X=\tan\Theta$? We know that $\text{Range}(X)=\mathbb{R}$, so for any $x\in\mathbb{R}$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_X(x)
&=
P(X\leq x)
\\
&=
P(\tan\Theta\leq x)
\\
&=
P(\Theta\leq \tan^{-1}x)
\\
&=
F_{\Theta}(\tan^{-1}x)
\\
&=
\frac{\tan^{-1}x}{\pi}+\frac{1}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

So the density of $X$ is

$$
f_X(x)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}F_X(x)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}\left[\frac{\tan^{-1}x}{\pi}+\frac{1}{2}\right]=\frac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)},\quad x\in\mathbb{R}.
$$

This is the density of the **Cauchy distribution**.

## Problem 0: watch Gwen!

If $Z\sim\text{N}(0,\, 1)$, then what is the pdf of $Y=Z^2$? Turns out it's a member of the gamma family.

## Problem 1: now you try

Consider $X\sim \text{Gamma}(1,\,1)$. Its density is

$$
f_X(x)=e^{-x},\quad x>0.
$$

a.  What is the cdf of $X$?
b.  What are the range and pdf of $Y=\ln X$?
c.  Simulate `n=5000` draws of $Y$. Plot a histogram, and add a line plot of the density you derived in part b. They should match!

## Interlude

Given $X\sim f_X$, we want the density of $Y=g(X)$. In the three examples, you followed the same basic steps: 

- write the generic cdf of $Y$: $F_Y(y)=P(Y\leq y)=P(g(X)\leq y)$;
- rewrite the event inside until $X$ is by itself (you probably have to undo or *invert* $g$ to do this);
- since $X$ is by itself, rewrite the probability using the cdf of $X$;
- differentiate (you probably have to use the chain rule to do this).

The basic template can be neatly summarized with the so-called change-of-variables formula, which tells you how to compute the density of $Y$ using the density of $X$ and the transformation $g$:

$$
f_Y(y)=f_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \left|\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\right|,\quad y\in\text{Range}(Y).
$$

## Wanna see the proof?
Assume...

- $X$ is absolutely continuous with pdf $f_X$;
- $g$ is defined for all $x\in\text{Range}(X)$;
- $g$ is differentiable and either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing (hence, invertible).

There are two cases:

::: {.columns }
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Strictly increasing**

This means that $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)$ must be positive for all $y$! It also means that $g$ is order-*preserving*. If $a\leq b$, then $g(a)\leq g(b)$. 

Fix arbitrary $y\in\text{Range}(Y)$. Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_Y(y)
    &=
    P(Y\leq y)
    \\
    &=
    P\left(g(X)\leq y\right)
    \\
    &=
    P\left(X\leq g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \\
    &=
    F_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    .
\end{aligned}
$$

Taking a derivative and applying the chain rule gives 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_Y(y)
    &=
    \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}F_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \\
    &=
    f_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)\underbrace{\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)}_{\text{positive!}}
    \\
    &=
    f_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \left|\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\right|.
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Strictly decreasing**

This means that $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)$ must be negative for all $y$! It also means that $g$ is order-*reversing*. If $a\leq b$, then $g(a)\geq g(b)$. 

Fix arbitrary $y\in\text{Range}(Y)$. Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_Y(y)
    &=
    P(Y\leq y)
    \\
    &=
    P\left(g(X)\leq y\right)
    \\
    &=
    P\left(X> g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \\
    &=
    1-P\left(X\leq g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \\
    &=
    1-F_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    .
\end{aligned}
$$
Taking a derivative and applying the chain rule gives 

$$
\begin{align*}
    f_Y(y)
    &=
    \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}[1-F_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)]
    \\
    &=
    {\color{red}-}f_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)\underbrace{\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)}_{\text{negative!}}
    \\
    &=
    f_X\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)
    \left|\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} y}g^{-1}(y)\right|.
\end{align*}
$$

Either way, we got to the same place.

## Problem 1.5

Use the change-of-variables formula to re-do Problem 1. You should get the same answer.

## Problem 2: location-scale transformations

Let $X$ be an absolutely continuous random variable with pdf $f_X$, let $a>0$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}$ be constants, and consider the new random variable $Y=aX+b$.

a.  What is $E(Y)$?
b.  What is $\text{var}(Y)$?
c.  Use the change-of-variables formula to find the density of $Y$?
d.  In the special case where $X\sim\text{N}(0,\,1)$, what are $E(Y)$, $\text{var}(Y)$, and the density of $Y$? There's no need to re-derive anything here. Just plug what you know about N(0, 1) into the formulas from parts a, b, and c.
