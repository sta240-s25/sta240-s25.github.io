# Why should you study the mathematics of probability and statistics?

# Reason 1: It's necessary.

## Example: the birthday problem

## Example: the Monty Hall problem

## Example: the wisdom of crowds

## Example: the folly of doctors

## Reason 1: It's necessary. {.large}

Human intuition and “common sense” about probability and statistics are often just flat out wrong, in silly and dangerous ways. Mere mortals require the scaffolding of mathematics to discipline our thinking.

# Reason 2: It's useful.

## 

Wigner

## Example: finance

## Example: insurance

## Example: LLMs

## Example: something else

Learning probability theory gives you serious wings to study large swathes of science and technology.

# Reason 3: It's beautiful.

## Bertrand Russell, [*Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mysticism_and_Logic_and_Other_Essays/Chapter_04) (1917)

Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.

## Albert Einstein, ["The Late Emmy Noether"](https://www.nytimes.com/1935/05/04/archives/the-late-emmy-noether-professor-einstein-writes-in-appreciation-of.html?smid=url-share) (1935)

Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.

## Why study mathematical probstat?

1.  It's necessary.

    -   Humans suck at thinking about this stuff.

2.  It's useful.

    -   It makes studying other things so much easier.

3.  It's beautiful.

    -   This is the main reason, honestly.

## Final grade breakdown

Your final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category       | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Labs           | 10%        |
| Problem Sets   | 30%        |
| Midterm Exam 1 | 20%        |
| Midterm Exam 2 | 20%        |
| Final exam     | 20%        |

::: callout-warning
The final letter grade will be based on the usual thresholds, which will not change and will be applied exactly. So no curve and no rounding.

## Labs

## Problem Sets

## Three in-class exams

No resources besides an 8.5" x 11" note sheet:

-   **Midterm 1**: Monday February 17;
-   **Midterm 2**: Monday March 31;
-   **Final Exam**: Saturday May 3.

::: callout-note
## A little bit of grace...

Lowest midterm score is replaced with final exam score if it's better.
