We will illuminate these connections throughout the semester, and I will refer to Problem Set 0 often. Stay tuned!\n\n## Problem 0\n\nRecommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.\n\n## Problem 1\n\nExplain why this is horrific notation:\n\n$$\n    \\int_0^x f(x)\\,\\textrm{d} x.\n$$\n\n## Problem 2\n\nAssume $\\lambda>0$ is a constant and compute\n\n$$\n    \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty n \\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\\lambda}\n    .\n$$\n\n## Problem 3\n\nHere is a very silly function:\n\n$$\n    h(x)\n    =\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n    ,\\quad \n    -\\infty<x<\\infty\n    .\n$$\n\nTreat $-\\infty<\\mu<\\infty$ and $\\sigma>0$ as constants and compute the value(s) of $x$ at which $h$ has *inflection points*.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nHere is an example of what $h$ might look like in the special case where $\\mu = 1$ and $\\sigma=2$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](pset_0_files/figure-html/silly-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBefore you start doing any math, can you use the picture to guess what the answer will be?\n:::\n\n## Problem 4\n\nHere is another inordinately silly function:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma(x)=\\int_0^\\infty y^{x-1}e^{-y}\\,\\textrm{d} y,\\quad x>0.\n$$\n\nProve that $\\Gamma(x+1)=x\\Gamma(x)$.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nStart on the left-hand side by writing out $\\Gamma(x+1)$ and evaluating the integral *by parts*.\n:::\n\n## Problem 5\n\nLet $f$ be any function with the following properties:\n\n-   $f$ is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of 0;\n-   $f(0) = 0$;\n-   $f'(0) = 0$;\n-   $f''(0) = 1$.\n\nAssume $t$ is a constant and compute\n\n$$\n    \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} xf\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{x}}\\right)\n    .\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nAre you allowed to simply \"plug in\" $\\infty$ for $x$ and simplify the expression? If so, why is that allowed? If not, what do you have to do instead?\n:::\n\n## Problem 6\n\nConsider this integral:\n\n$$\n    \\int_2^\\infty \n    \\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^p}\\textrm{d} x\n    .\n$$\n\na.  Use a computer to create a single plot with many lines, each graphing the *integrand* for a different value of $p$. Consider $p$ equal to -2, -1.5, -1, 0, 1, and 5, and make the $x$-axis of your plot run from 2 to 15.\nb.  Show that $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^p}=0$ for all values of $-\\infty<p<\\infty$.\nc.  For what values of $p$ does the integral converge? When it does converge, what is its value?\nd.  Consult the picture you created in part (a), and write a few sentences explaining conceptually why the integral converges for some values of $p$ but not others.\n\n::: callout-note\n## \"Use a computer\"\n\nThis is deliberately vague. You are welcome to use any tool you are familiar with: graphing calculator, GeoGebra, Desmos, R, Matlab, Mathematica, WolframAlpha, Julia, Maple, etc. Just make sure to plop a single image file, however crude, into your final submission.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nWhen taking the limit or evaluating the integral, can you use the same technique for all values of $p$, or do you need a different technique depending on what $p$ is?\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nYou are free to compose your solutions for this problem set however you wish (scan or photograph written work, handwriting capture on a tablet device, LaTeX, Quarto, whatever) as long as the final product is a single PDF file. You must upload this to Gradescope and mark the pages associated with each problem.\n\n## Point values\n\n| Problem   | Points |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 1         | 2      |\n| 2         | 3      |\n| 3         | 3      |\n| 4         | 3      |\n| 5         | 3      |\n| 6.a       | 2      |\n| 6.b       | 3      |\n| 6.c       | 3      |\n| 6.d       | 2      |\n| **TOTAL** | **24** |\n",
