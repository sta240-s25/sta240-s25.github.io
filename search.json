    "text": "Task 6\nUp to now we’ve been worrying a lot about individual words, but individual words don’t create meaning. It’s how those words interact across phrases and sentences and paragraphs. Unfortunately, we do not have methods for inducing a probability distribution over the set of all possible sentences, or the set of all possible thoughts. But in a sense, language models are attempting to approximate such a thing. And on the evidence to date, maybe they succeed sometimes. Anyway, how do we go from a method that gets things right on the word level to a method that gets things right on the sentence level? Well, therein lies the art of the engineers that work on these things, and one method they have found helpful is called temperature sampling.\nSo far, given the current context, the model returns a (conditional) probability \\(p(i)\\) for each word \\(i\\in \\text{corpus}\\). So far we’ve used these probabilities unmodified. With temperature sampling, before we draw the next word, we would first adjust the probabilities based on a user-defined tuning parameter \\(t&gt;0\\) called the temperature:\n\\[\np_t(i) = \\frac{e^{\\frac{\\ln p(i)}{t}}}{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in\\text{corpus}}e^{\\frac{\\ln p(j)}{t}}},\\quad i\\in\\text{corpus}.\n\\]\nIf \\(t=1\\), we’re back to the original probabilities (check this!). Otherwise, to quote the \\(k\\)-grams people, “higher and lower temperatures make the original probability distribution smoother and rougher, respectively. By making a physical analogy, we can think of less probable words as states with higher energies, and the effect of higher (lower) temperatures is to make more (less) likely to excite these high energy states.” Why do people do this? To the best of my knowledge, it is no deeper than “it seems to work well.” In practice, adjusting the temperature seems to have a macro effect on the overall character of the sentences.\nThe function next_word_probs that we gave you has a fourth argument temp where you can give it a number and it will give you the tempered probabilities. Play around with big and small values, and report any effect that it has on the overall quality of the sentences.",

    "text": "Task 2\nOne of the main ideas in classical statistics is sampling variability. We model data as a random sample from an unknown distribution. Different random samples will give different point and interval estimates. So the point and interval estimates are themselves random quantities, and we can itemize their performance and reliability by studying their sampling distribution and seeing how the estimates vary across datasets. If they vary a little, we are comforted. If they vary a lot, we are troubled.\n\nFill in this function:\n\n\nsampling_distribution &lt;- function(p0, n, M){\n  # p0: the true probability of success\n  # n: the sample size of each iid dataset from Bern(p0)\n  # M: the number of alternative datasets to generate\n}\n\nInside, you should have a for loop. The loop cycles through \\(M\\) iterations, each time simulating a data set of size \\(n\\) from Bern(p0). For each of those datasets, compute the sample proportion of ones (“successes”) in that dataset. At the end, you will have a collection of \\(M\\) estimates. So, \\(M\\) realizations of \\(\\hat{p}_n\\). Plot a histogram of them: I like breaks = \"Scott\" as you know, make sure it’s a density histogram, and fix the range of the horizontal axis to xlim = c(0, 1).\n\nPlay around with your function. Adjust p0 and n and see what happens to the picture. In particular, convince yourself of these facts we have proven:\n\nthe sampling distribution is centered on the true value;\nthe sampling distribution’s spread (variance) shrinks as the sample size grows;\nthe shape of the sampling distribution resembles a bell curve for large \\(n\\);\n\nHere’s something true that we haven’t proven. The convergence of the sampling distribution to the normal is faster when the underlying distribution of the data is symmetric, and slower when the underlying distribution is highly skewed (this is a consequence of the Berry-Esseen theorem). What does that mean in this case? Can you use your function to illustrate that?",

    "text": "How does one count? (I do it.)\n\nCoin Toss\nWe first consider the flip of a fair coin. That is, when flipped, the coin will equiprobably come up heads or tails. Suppose we try to illustrate the fairness of a coin by physically flipping it a bunch of times. Very quickly, this becomes tedious and labor-intensive; surely, no reasonable/sane person would want to do this by hand…\n(Though, on the off chance that somebody actually did this, at least you might get co-authorship and recognition from various sectors of media.)\nAt any rate, R provides a much more enticing, efficient alternative to being one of about \\(50\\) people flipping coins thousands of times.\nFirst, let’s define a vector with the sample space – all possible outcomes – of a single coin flip. We notate heads as H and tails as T, and we call the vector sides_of_coin.\n\nsides_of_coin &lt;- c(\"H\", \"T\")\n\nTo simulate an actual coin flip, R has this nifty built-in function called sample().\n\nThe sample() function\nThe sample() function can take many arguments: a vector of elements (the sample space), a positive integer (the size), a Boolean (with or without replacement), and a vector of probabilities. So, a call to sample() will return a random sample of the specified size from the sample space, either with or without replacement, according to the vector of probabilities.\nNOTE: The replace Boolean defaults to FALSE (without replacement), and the prob vector defaults to equal weighting among the elements in the sample space.\n\n\nSample flips\nWe can perform a single coin flip with the following function call.\n\nsample(sides_of_coin, 1)\n\n[1] \"H\"\n\n\nIf we wanted to simulate multiple coin flips in the same vector, sample() lets us do that as well! Below is an example of a simulation of \\(10\\) coin flips.\n\nsample(sides_of_coin, 10, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] \"T\" \"H\" \"T\" \"H\" \"T\" \"H\" \"H\" \"T\" \"H\" \"H\"\n\n\nWe can also use a different tool to simulate multiple fair coin flips: a for-loop.\n\n\nfor-loops\nA for-loop is a great way to perform the same set of commands a fixed, known number of times or to perform the same set of commands on the different elements in a vector. The bare bones of the for-loop are given below.\n\nfor(){\n  \n}\n\nIn the parentheses (), you define the variable and values of iteration; in the brackets {}, you list the commands to be performed in each iteration.\n\n\nSimulating the flips\nWe will simulation \\(5,000\\) independent flips of a fair coin and track whether each flip came up heads. We do this by initializing a \\(5,000\\)-element vector of zeroes and replacing each zero with a TRUE or FALSE according to the result of the current coin flip. You may find the corresponding code below.\n\nn_reps &lt;- 5000\nwas_it_heads &lt;- numeric(n_reps)\nfor(m in 1:n_reps){\n  new_flip &lt;- sample(sides_of_coin, 1)\n  was_it_heads[m] &lt;- new_flip == \"H\"\n}\n\nTo calculate the empirical probability of the coin coming up heads, we will calculate the proportion of flips in our simulation that came up heads. To do this, we can use either the mean() or sum() function; while those functions are typically used to average or sum vectors of numbers, they can also be used on Boolean vectors like was_it_heads. It will treat each TRUE as a one and each FALSE as a zero in the calculation.\nWe use each function in the code chunk below, remembering to divide the sum() call by the number of flips n_rep.\n\ncoin_prob &lt;- mean(was_it_heads)\ncoin_prob\n\n[1] 0.508\n\nsum(was_it_heads) / n_reps\n\n[1] 0.508\n\n\nAs expected, we see a proportion rather close to \\(0.5\\)! Due to the randomness of the individual flips and the finite number of flips, you likely won’t observe a proportion exactly equal to \\(0.5\\). However, the closeness of the proportion to the true probability is an illustration of the frequentist phenomenon of the long-run average. If you play around with the number of flips, you’ll tend to see that the longer the run, the closer the proportion to the true probability.\n\n\n\nFive-Card Poker Hand\nSuppose you are playing some sort of card game with a standard \\(52\\)-card deck. As part of this game, you are dealt a hand of five cards, the composition of which has some bearing on your success in the game.\nProvided is a vector representing the deck of cards, aptly (in my humble opinion) called deck_of_cards.\n\ndeck_of_cards &lt;- c(\"AH\", \"2H\", \"3H\", \"4H\", \"5H\", \"6H\", \"7H\", \"8H\", \"9H\", \"10H\", \"JH\", \"QH\", \"KH\", \"AD\", \"2D\", \"3D\", \"4D\", \"5D\", \"6D\", \"7D\", \"8D\", \"9D\", \"10D\", \"JD\", \"QD\", \"KD\", \"AC\", \"2C\", \"3C\", \"4C\", \"5C\", \"6C\", \"7C\", \"8C\", \"9C\", \"10C\", \"JC\", \"QC\", \"KC\", \"AS\", \"2S\", \"3S\", \"4S\", \"5S\", \"6S\", \"7S\", \"8S\", \"9S\", \"10S\", \"JS\", \"QS\", \"KS\")\n\nRecall that each card in a deck has one of four “suits” (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) and one of four ranks (Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King). In the above vector, each card is thus represented as a string (sequences of characters between quotation marks) with the (abbreviated) rank and (abbreviated) suit.\nOne hand of interest is called a “full house,” consisting of three cards of one rank and two cards of a different rank. (For example, {4 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, 4 of Spades, 4 of Clubs, 3 of Spades} would be a full house, but {4 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, 4 of Spades, 4 of Clubs, Queen of Spades} would not be a full house.)\nSo, we want to calculate the probability of getting a full house!\n\nSimulation and empirical calculation\nHere’s a sample (hehe, see what I did there?) piece of code to simulate the dealing of a single five-card hand.\n\nsample(deck_of_cards, 5)\n\n[1] \"7D\" \"4S\" \"3H\" \"3S\" \"3D\"\n\n\nAs in the previous coin-flipping example, we will use a for-loop to simulate \\(5,000\\) different five-card hands. (Imagine that, after dealing each hand, we re-incorporate the dealt hand into the deck and shuffle thoroughly before the next hand is dealt.) We keep track of whether each hand was a full house in other \\(5,000\\)-element vector of Booleans; below are helper functions I defined in order to check whether a particular hand was a full house.\n\nsplit_card &lt;- function(card){\n  return(c(substr(card, 1, nchar(card) - 1), substr(card, nchar(card), nchar(card))))\n}\n\nis_full_house &lt;- function(hand){\n  ranks &lt;- numeric(5)\n  for(c in 1:5){\n    ranks[c] &lt;- split_card(hand[c])[1]\n  }\n  return(length(unique(ranks)) == 2)\n}\n\nWe then have the following code for the simulation.\n\nn_reps &lt;- 5000\nwas_house_full &lt;- numeric(n_reps)\nfor(m in 1:n_reps){\n  new_hand &lt;- sample(deck_of_cards, 5)\n  was_house_full[m] &lt;- is_full_house(new_hand)\n}\n\nAs before, we calculate the empirical probability using both the mean() function and the sum() function.\n\nfivecard_prob &lt;- mean(was_house_full)\nfivecard_prob\n\n[1] 0.002\n\nsum(was_house_full) / n_reps\n\n[1] 0.002\n\n\nThe true probability is approximately \\(0.0014\\) – the long-run average simulations strike again!",

The fundamental principle of simulation is that any distribution can be simulated by first simulating from the standard uniform, and then applying a transformation.\nThe Box-Muller method says that we can simulate the standard normal in the following way:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nU_1,\\,U_2&\\overset{\\textrm{iid}}{\\sim}\\textrm{Unif}(0,\\,1)\\\\\nZ&=\\sqrt{-2\\ln U_1}\\cos(2\\pi U_2)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo \\(Z\\sim\\text{N}(0,\\,1)\\). It is not hard to prove this if you’ve taken multivariable calculus (yaaay polar coordinates), but our course does not assume this. Nevertheless, we can still implement the sampler and check that it works.\n\nUse the Box-Muller method to simulate 5000 random numbers from N(0, 1). Check that you did it right by plotting the histogram and superimposing the standard normal density;\nModify your code to simulate \\(\\text{N}(\\mu=-3.5,\\,\\sigma^2=0.58)\\), and compare a histogram with a density to verify that it works.",

To remind you, we were modeling insurance claims in the following way:\n\n\\(N\\sim\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda=100)\\) is a discrete random variable counting the number of claims that an insurance company receives in a given month;\n\\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), … are continuous random variables representing the dollar amount of each claim;\n\\(S=X_1+X_2+...+X_N\\) is the total amount of money the company has to pay out. It’s a new random variable that inherits its randomness from both \\(N\\) and the \\(X_i\\). If \\(S\\) ends up being too large, the company will go broke.\n\nFor simplicity we assume everything is independent here, which is a totally bogus assumption. But oh well:\n\nZoom in for a second on a single claim amount \\(X\\) and assume \\(X\\sim\\text{Gamma}(\\alpha,\\,\\beta)\\). If we know from historical experience that claims are typically around $10,000 with a standard deviation of $2,000, what values should we pick for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) so that \\(X\\) has the right center and spread?\nUse R to simulate n = 5000 random numbers from the gamma distribution. Plot a histogram of these numbers, and overlay a line plot of the density.\nVerify that the sample mean and sample variance of your random numbers are close to the prescriptions from part a. If they are not, revisit part a and adjust your choice of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) until this works.\nWhat is the probability \\(P(X &gt; 15000)\\)? Calculate this probability exactly using the appropriate p- function, and also approximate it using your random numbers from part b. Verify that the two numbers are close.\nWrite a function in R that simulates \\(S\\). So your function should spit out a single number, generated in the following way:\n\nSimulate \\(N\\);\nGiven the result of Step 1, simulate independent \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), …, \\(X_N\\);\nGiven the result of Step 2, return \\(S=X_1+X_2+...+X_N\\).\n\nUsing the function you wrote in the previous task, simulate \\(n=5000\\) possible values for the random variable \\(S\\) and plot a histogram of them.\nUse your simulations to approximate the probability \\(P(S&gt;130000)\\).\nCompute the sample mean and the sample variance of your simulations. Based on these, can you conjecture how the parameters of the underlying \\(\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\) and \\(\\text{Gamma}(\\alpha,\\,\\beta)\\) distributions are related to \\(E(S)\\) and \\(\\text{var}(S)\\)? That is, propose formulas \\(E(S)=h(\\lambda,\\,\\alpha,\\,\\beta)\\) and \\(\\text{var}(S)=g(\\lambda,\\,\\alpha,\\,\\beta)\\) that describe how the underlying Poisson and gamma parameters determine the moments of \\(S\\).",
