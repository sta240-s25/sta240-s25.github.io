    "text": "Regrade requests\nIf you receive a graded assignment back, and you believe that some part of it was graded incorrectly, you may dispute the grade by submitting a regrade request in Gradescope. Note the following:\n\nYou have one week after you receive a grade to submit a regrade request;\nYou should submit separate regrade requests for each question you wish to dispute, not a single catch-all request;\nRequests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect;\nRequests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered;\nRegrade requests are not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback. Those questions should be brought to office hours;\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered on Tuesday, April 29;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nA regrade request can result in your grade going up, staying the same, or going down if we determine that, in fact, the original grader was too lenient.",

    "text": "Attendance\nFor the most part, attendance is not strictly required. You are an adult, and you are free to live your life. The responsibility lies with us to make class meetings sufficiently engaging and informative that you choose to attend. Having said that, success in this class and regular attendance are probably highly positively correlated. Furthermore, regular lecture attendance is likely the path of least resistance toward earning full credit for the application exercises. Lastly, there are some aspects of the final project that will require you to attend your lab section so that you can convene with your teammates.\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at the link below (!!!). Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.",

    "text": "Use of outside resources, including AI\nYou may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you’re using (e.g., ChatGPT) and your prompt. The prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such.\nNEED TO ADD EXAMPLE OF PROPER CITATION.",
