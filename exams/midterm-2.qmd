# Problem 1

Consider a nonnegative, absolutely continuous random variable with cdf

$$
F_X(x)
=
\begin{cases}
1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right) & x\geq 0
\\
0 & x<0.
\end{cases}
$$

a.  What is $P(2\leq X\leq 3)$;
b.  What is the density of $X$?
c.  What is $E(X^n)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$?
d.  What is $\text{var}(X)$?
e.  What is the median of $X$?


# Problem 2

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with

| $x$      | -1  | 3   | 7   |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| $P(X=x)$ | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.3 |

a.  Compute the mgf of $X$.
b.  Compute the mean two ways: using the definition, and using the mgf. Confirm that you get the same answer.
c.  Compute the variance two ways: using the definition, and using the mgf. Confirm that you get the same answer.



# Problem 3

Let $X$ have density

$$
f_X(x)
=
\frac{1}{2}
e^{-|x|},\quad x\in\mathbb{R}.
$$

a.  What is the mgf of $X$?
b.  What is the mean?
c.  What is the variance?



# Problem 4

Let $X\sim\text{Unif}(0,\,1)$, and find the density of $Y=X^2$.



# Problem 5

Consider this joint distribution written in hierarchical form:

$$
\begin{align*}
X & \sim\text{Unif}(0,\,1)\\
Y\,|\,X = x & \sim \text{Unif}(0,\,x).
\end{align*}
$$

a.  What is the joint range?
b.  What is the marginal density of $Y$?
c.  What is the conditional density of $X$?
