---

Our final exam is **Saturday May 3 from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM**. There will be 11 questions, and they will break down as follows:

0.  (Some undisclosed check on your visual intuition, like the matching you've already seen. I will say no more about this, and you will do very well on it.)
1.  Set theory and basic probability rules
2.  Counting
3.  Conditional probability
4.  Discrete random variables
5.  Absolutely continuous random variables
6.  The moment-generating function
7.  Transformations of random variables
8.  Joint distributions
9.  Maximum likelihood estimation
10. Bayesian inference

Below are at least two practice problems for each of these ten items, as well as guidance about what course materials to refer to if you want more review on a particular topic.

# 1. Set theory and basic probability rules

## Problem 1

Suppose the events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Under what conditions are $A^{c}$ and $B^{c}$ also disjoint events?

## Problem 2

Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be three arbitrary events, and let $D$ denote the event that "exactly one of these three events occurs."

a.  Draw a cartoon of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$;
b.  Use the three basic set operations (union, intersection, and complement) to express $D$ in terms of $A$, $B$, and $C$;
c.  Show that

$$P(D)=P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - 2P(A \cap B) - 2P(A \cap C) - 2P(B \cap C) + 3P(A \cap B \cap C).$$

# 2. Counting

## Problem 3

The United States Senate contains two senators -- one senior and one junior -- from each of the $50$ states.

a.  If a committee of eight senators is selected, what is the probability that it will contain at least one of the two senators from a certain specified state?
b.  If a committee of twenty senators is selected, what is the probability it will contain $15$ junior senators and $5$ senior senators?
c.  What is the probability that a group of $50$ senators selected at random will contain one senator from each state?

## Problem 4

Congratulations! You and two of your friends are now proud owners of brand-new library cards. In order to use your new cards, all you and your friends need to do is create four-digit PINs, with numbers $0$ - $9$ available (in theory) at each position. Predictably, all of you have different ideas of what an acceptable PIN is (odd or even, leading zeros or not, etc.).

a.  You are fairly chill about what you want in a PIN -- all you want is an even PIN, and you're totally fine if it starts with a zero. How many possible PINs fit your preference?
b.  One of your friends is a bit more persnickety -- they want a PIN divisible by $5$, and they cannot stand PINs starting with a zero. How many possible PINs fit this friend's preferences?
c.  Your other friend has some more...particular preferences -- they have an affinity for the number $16$ and thus want the digits $1$ and $6$ to appear in that exact order at some point in the PIN. Further, they also despise PINs starting with a zero. How many possible PINs fit this friend's preferences?

Consider this function:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - e^{-g(x)} & x\geq 0\\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$

Assume $g(x)$ is a continuous function. What properties must $g(x)$ satisfy in order for $F(x)$ to be a valid cumulative distribution function (CDF)? Give three examples of functions $g(x)$ that satisfy these properties.

# 7. Transformations

## Problem 13

Let $X\sim\text{Gamma}(\alpha,\,\beta)$, and define a new random variable $Y=1/X$?

a.  What is the density of $Y$?
b.  What is $E(Y)$?
c.  What is $\text{var}(Y)$?

::: callout-note
A random variable possessing this new density is said to follow the **inverse gamma distribution**.

## Problem 14

Let $X$ be a nonnegative continuous random variable with this density:

$$
f(x\,|\,\theta)=\theta(x+1)^{-(\theta+1)},\quad x>0.
$$

Treat $\theta>0$ as a constant, and define a new random variable $Y=\ln(X+1)$.

b.  What is the density of $Y$?
c.  Is the density of $Y$ familiar?

## Problem 15

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with this density:

$$
f(x\,|\,\theta)
=
\frac{1}{2\theta}\exp\left(-\frac{|x|}{\theta}\right), \quad -\infty<x<\infty.
$$

Treat $\theta>0$ as a constant, and define a new random variable $Y=|X|$.

a.  Sketch what this density looks like for $\theta=1$.
b.  What is the range of $Y$?
c.  What is the density of $Y$?
d.  Is the density of $Y$ familiar?

# 10. Bayesian inference

## Problem 20

Consider the following Bayesian model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p&\sim\text{Beta}(a_0,\,b_0)&& \text{(prior)}\\
X_1,\,X_2,\,...,\,X_n\,|\,p&\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\text{Geometric}(p).&& \text{(likelihood)}
\end{aligned}
$$

a.  What is the posterior distribution?
b.  Compute the posterior mean and show that it is a weighted average of the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimator.
c.  State an 82% credible interval for $p$.

## Problem 21

Recall this family of distributions from Problems 14 and 18 above:

$$
f(x\,|\,\theta)=\theta(x+1)^{-(\theta+1)},\quad x>0.
$$

If we observed iid data from some unknown member of this family, we could perform Bayesian inference for the unknown parameter $\theta>0$ with the following model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta&\sim\text{Gamma}(a_0,\,b_0) && \text{(prior)}\\
X_1,\,X_2,\,...,\,X_n\,|\,\theta&\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}f(x\,|\,\theta).  && \text{(likelihood)}
\end{aligned}
$$

a.  What is the posterior distribution of $\theta$?
b.  Compute the posterior mean and show that it is a convex combination of the prior mean and the mle.
c.  State a 90% credible interval for $\theta$.

-   [Problem 3 on PSET 6](https://sta240-s25.github.io/psets/pset_6.html#problem-3);
-   Note also that these prior-posterior calculations are the same as when we wrote joint distributions hierarchically and then solved for the marginals and conditionals. As such, you can also consult all of those examples:
    -   the Poisson-binomial hierarchy;
    -   the gamma-normal hierarchy that motivated Student's $t$ distribution;
    -   the [beta-gamma hierarchy](https://sta240-s25.github.io/psets/pset_5.html#problem-15) from Problem Set 5.
