title: "Final Exam Study Guide"
---

Our final exam is **Saturday May 3 from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM**. There will be 11 questions, and they will break down as follows:

1. Basic probability rules
2. Counting
3. Conditional probability
4. Discrete random variables
5. Absolutely continuous random variables
6. The moment-generating function
7. Transformations of random variables
8. Joint distributions
9. Maximum likelihood estimation
10. Bayesian inference
11. Some undisclosed check on your visual intuition (like the matching you've already seen). I will say no more about this, and you will do very well on it.

## What calculus do I need to know

finite geometric sum
geometric series 
taylor series of exponential

power rule 
chain rule 
log/exp rule 
product rule 

u sub 
integration by parts 
improper integration

lhopital 

"massage and squint"

Multivariable calculus is *not* a pre-requisite for our course, and so there will be no partial differentiation or double integration.
