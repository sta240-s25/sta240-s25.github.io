title: "Extra Practice for Midterm 1"
---

On Monday February 17 during our usual class meeting, we have our first midterm exam. It will cover the following topics:

- Set theory;
- Probability axioms and basic rules;
- Counting methods;
- Conditional probability and independence;
- Random variables in general, and discrete random variables in particular.

Below is a set of practice problems to help you prepare. 

# Set theory

## Problem X

Take $\mathbb{R}$ to be your reference set and consider these subsets:

$$
\begin{align}
    A & = \mathbb{Z} = \{\dots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,\dots\}\\
    B & = (0, 1)\\
    C & = [0, \infty).
\end{align}
$$

Express the following in as simplified and concise a form as possible:

a. $A \cap C$
b. $B \cup C^{c}$
c. $B^{c} \cap C$
d. $A \cap B \cap C$

# Probability axioms and basic rules

## Problem X

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events for which $P(A) = 0.3$ and $P(B) = 0.5$. What is the probability that...

a. either $A$ or $B$ occurs?
b. $A$ occurs but $B$ does not?
c. both $A$ and $B$ occur?
d. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Why or why not?

# Counting methods

## Problem X

Suppose you have a set $A$ of objects. The *power set* of $A$ is defined to be the set of all possible subsets of $A$.

a. Let $A = \{1, 3, 5\}$. What is the power set of $A$?
b. Suppose $A$ contains some number of items given by $N > 0$. How many sets are contained in the power set of $A$?

# Conditional probability and independence

## Problem X

Let's talk face cards. No, not *those* face cards -- the boring kind. In a standard deck of $52$ cards, 3 (Jack, Queen, and King) of the 13 ranks are collectively known as the ``face cards" of the deck. Recall that a standard deck of $52$ cards also has $4$ suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades).

Suppose you deal out two cards from the deck. What is the probability that they are both face cards given that they are both hearts?

## Problem X 

Some of the greatest creations in the history of the universe have been born of mash-ups. You want breakfast and lunch? You got brunch! You want drama and comedy? You got dramedy! Perhaps the greatest mash-up of all: you want conditional probability and independent events? You got conditionally independent events!

Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be events with $\mathbb{P}(C) > 0$. $A$ and $B$ are *conditionally independent* given $C$ if and only if 

$$
P(A \cap B \mid C) = P(A \mid C)P(B \mid C).
$$ 

Show that the above implies $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B, C) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid C)$.

# Random variables

## Problem X

Suppose you have a sequence of independent $\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ trials; that is, each trial has probability $p$ of success. We are interested in seeing how long it takes to observe a fixed number $r > 0$ of successes and thus repeat the trials until we observe $r$ successes. Let $A$ be the number of the trial at which we observe the $r$th success.

a. What is the sample space of $A$?
b. Fix $n > 0$. What is the probability that we observe the $r$th success on the $n$th trial?

## Problem X

Let $D \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$, and fix $n, k > 0$. What is $P(D = n + k \,|\, D > k)$? Does this look familiar?
