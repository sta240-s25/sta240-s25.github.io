## Technology

You will need to bring a laptop to all lectures and labs. Options for obtaining a laptop through the university are described here (!!!). Armed with your trusty laptop, you must be able to access the following:

-   [This course page](https://sta199-s25.github.io/) that you are on right now;
-   `R`/`RStudio` as provided by the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers);
-   [Canvas](https://go.canvas.duke.edu/), through which you can access...
    -   Gradescope;
    -   Ed Discussion;
-   [Zoom](https://duke.zoom.us/) (e.g. for remote office hours).

If access to technology becomes a concern for you during the semester, contact the instructor immediately to discuss options.
