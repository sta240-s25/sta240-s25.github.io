## Problem 0

Recommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.

## Problem X

a. Let $X\sim\text{Unif}(0,\,1)$ and compute the pdf of $Y=e^X$.
b. Let $X\sim \textrm{N}(\mu\com\sigma^2)$ and compute the pdf of $Y=e^X$.
c. Let $Z\sim\textrm{N}(0\com1)$, and find the pdf, mean, and variance of $Y=|Z|$.
d. Let $X\sim\textrm{N}(0\com\sigma^2)$, and find the pdf, mean, and variance of $W=|X|$.

## Problem X

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are jointly absolutely continuous random variables with joint density

$$
f_{XY}(x,\,y)=xe^{-x(y+1)},\quad x,\,y>0.
$$

a. Find the marginal density of $X$. Is it familiar?
b. Find the marginal density of $Y$.
c. Find the conditional density of $X$ given $Y=y$.
d. Find the conditional density of $Y$ given $X=x$. Is it familiar?

## Problem X

Let $X$ be an absolutely continuous random variable with the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Range}(X)&=(0\com 1)\\
    f_X(x)&=\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1},
    \quad 0<x<1.
\end{aligned}
$$

This means $X$ has the **beta distribution**, and we write $X\sim\textrm{Beta}(a\com b)$. Now let $Y\sim\textrm{Gamma}(a+b\com c)$ be independent of $X$, and define a third random variable $Z=XY$.

a. Write the joint distribution of $X$ and $Z$ in hierarchical form:
$$
\begin{align*}
    X &\sim \textrm{???}\\
    Z\,|\, X = x &\sim \textrm{???}.
\end{align*}
$$
b. Based on this hierarchy, compute the marginal density of $Z$. Is it familiar?
