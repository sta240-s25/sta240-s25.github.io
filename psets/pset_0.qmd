title: "Problem Set 0"
---

This is ostensibly calculus review, but each problem is a piece of probability in disguise. We will illuminate these connections throughout the semester, and I will refer to Problem Set 0 often.

## Problem 1

Explain why this is horrific notation:

$$
    \int_0^x f(x)\,\textrm{d} x.
$$

## Problem 2

Assume $\lambda>0$ is a constant and compute

$$
    \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty n \frac{\lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\lambda}
    .
$$

## Problem 3

Here is a very silly function:

$$
    h(x)
    =
    \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right)
    ,\quad 
    -\infty<x<\infty
    .
$$

Treat $-\infty<\mu<\infty$ and $\sigma>0$ as constants and compute the value(s) of $x$ at which $h$ has *inflection points*.

Here is an example of what $h$ might look like in the special case where $\mu = 1$ and $\sigma=2$:

```{r}
#| label: silly
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: 0.5
m = 1
s = 2
x_vals <- seq(-6, 8, length.out = 500)
y_vals <- exp(-0.5 * ((x_vals - m) / s)^2)
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 4))
plot(x_vals, y_vals, type = "l", xlab = "x", ylab = "h(x)")
```

## Problem 4

Here is another inordinately silly function:

$$
\Gamma(x)=\int_0^\infty y^{x-1}e^{-y}\,\textrm{d} y,\quad x>0.
$$

Prove that $\Gamma(x+1)=x\Gamma(x)$.

## Problem 5

Imagine $f$ is some mystery function. These are the only things you know about it:

-   $f$ is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of 0;
-   $f(0) = 0$;
-   $f'(0) = 0$;
-   $f''(0) = 1$.

Assume $t$ is a constant and compute

$$
    \lim_{x\to\infty} xf\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{x}}\right)
    .
$$

## Problem 6

Consider this integral:

$$
    \int_2^\infty 
    \frac{1}{x(\ln x)^p}\textrm{d} x
    .
$$

a.  Show that $\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{x(\ln x)^p}=0$ for all values of $-\infty<p<\infty$.
b.  For what values of $p$ does the integral converge? When it does converge, what is its value?
c.  Use a computer to create a single plot with lines graphing the integrand for $p$ equal to -2, -1.5, -1, 0, 1, 5. Make the $x$-axis of your plot run from 2 to 15.
d.  Explain in words why the integral converges for some values of $p$ but not others.
