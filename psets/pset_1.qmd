## Problem 0

Recommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.

## Problem 1

Persi Diaconis is a famous researcher in probability and statistics. He has a cute line of research where he probes the randomness that we take for granted in simple things like coin tossing, dice, and playing cards. In this [Numberphile interview](https://youtu.be/AYnJv68T3MM), he discusses coin tossing, and says both "coin tossing is as close to a random phenomenon as I know" and "coin tossing is a deterministic process. What's random about it?" Wut?

Watch the interview, and report back with a brief summary of Diaconis' explanation of what makes a coin toss random. Do you agree or disagree?

## Problem 2

"Prove" De Morgan's second law with a picture:

$$
(A\cap B)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B^{c}.
$$

## Problem 3

Prove that

$$
P(A)+P(B)-1\leq P(A\cap B).
$$

## Problem 4

Let $A$ and $B$ be events in a sample space $S$. Let $C$ be the set of outcomes that are in either $A$ or $B$, but *not* both.

a.  Express $C$ in terms of $A$ and $B$ using any of the basic operations: union, intersection, complement. A picture will probably help.

b.  Prove that

$$
P(C)=P(A)+P(B)-2P(A\cap B).
$$

c.  Explain this result conceptually (with words and pictures).

## Submission

You are free to compose your solutions for this problem set however you wish (scan or photograph written work, handwriting capture on a tablet device, LaTeX, Quarto, whatever) as long as the final product is a single PDF file. You must upload this to Gradescope and mark the pages associated with each problem.
