## Problem 0

Recommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.

## Problem X

Seven balls are randomly withdrawn from an urn that contains 12 red, 16 blue, and 18 green balls. Find the probability that

a. 3 red, 2 blue, and 2 green balls are withdrawn;
b. at least 2 red balls are withdrawn;
c. all withdrawn balls are the same color;
d. either exactly 3 red balls or exactly 3 blue balls are withdrawn.

## Problem X

Let $A$ and $B$ be independent events. Prove that $A^c$ and $B^c$ are independent events.

## Problem X

A pair of fair dice is rolled until a sum of either a 5 or a 7 appears. What is the probability that a 5 occurs first?

## Problem X

Assume that $P(A)>0$ and prove that 

$$
P(A\cap B\,|\, A)\geq P(A\cap B\,|\, A\cup B).
$$

## Problem X

An encryption algorithm generates a seed value $z$ in the following way:

-   A binary operator is chosen at random from $\{+,\,\cdot\}$;

-   Two *distinct* numbers $x$ and $y$ are chosen at random from the set $\{1,\,2,\,...,\,9\}$ and the binary operation chosen above acts on $x$ and $y$ to produce $z$.

a.  What is the probability that $z$ is an even number?
b.  You notice that the algorithm generates an even $z$ value. Given this, what is the probability that the $+$ operator was used to generate it?

## Problem X

The figure above displays a circuit. Switch $S_i$ closes with probability $p_i$, and the switches close independently of one another. What is the probability that electricity can flow from $A$ to $G$?

## Submission

You are free to compose your solutions for this problem set however you wish (scan or photograph written work, handwriting capture on a tablet device, LaTeX, Quarto, whatever) as long as the final product is a single PDF file. You must upload this to Gradescope and mark the pages associated with each problem.
