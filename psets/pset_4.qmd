## Problem 0

Recommend some music for us to listen to while we grade this.

## Problem 1

One fine day you are walking down the street when you are accosted by some shyster. He wants to charge you $c$ dollars to play the following game:

-   The man will flip a fair coin until a tail appears for the first time;
-   If the tail appears on the $n$th flip, you will win $2^n$ dollars.

Let $X$ denote your winnings when you play this game.

a.  What is the range of $X$?
b.  What is the pmf of $X$?
c.  What is $E(X)$?
d.  How much would you be willing to pay for the chance to play this game once? Explain your thought-process.
e.  You say to the guy "Now wait just a gosh-darned minute. Let's say for the sake of argument that the first tail does not appear until the hundredth flip ($n=100$). In that case you'd have to pay me $2^{100}\approx 1.26 Ã— 10^{30}$ dollars. Do you even have that kind of dough?" The guy says "Well, no. I only have $\$W$ to pay you with, so if this goes on long enough, we'd just have to stop, and I'd have to give you all of my money." Let $Y$ denote your winnings when you play this *new* game that terminates once the guy runs out of money. What is $E(Y)$, and how much would you be willing to pay for the chance to play this game once?

## Problem 2

If $X\sim\text{Binomial}(n,\,p)$, show that

$$
E\left[\frac{1}{X+1}\right]=\frac{1-(1-p)^{n+1}}{(n+1)p}.
$$

## Problem 3

Let $X$ be an absolutely continuous random variable with pdf $f$ and cdf $F$, and assume that $E[(X-a)^2]$ and $E\left[|X-a|\right]$ are finite for all $a\in \mathbb{R}$.

a.  Compute and interpret

$$
a_0=\underset{a\in\mathbb{R}}{\arg\min}\,E[(X-a)^2].
$$

b.  Compute and interpret

$$
b_0=\underset{b\in\mathbb{R}}{\arg\min}\,E\left[|X-b|\right].
$$


## Problem 4

An absolutely continuous random variable $X$ has pdf

$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{3}{22}[5 - (x-1)^2] & 1\leq x \leq3\\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$

a.  Confirm that $f$ is a valid pdf.
b.  Find the cdf of $X$ and plot it.
c.  Compute $E(X)$.

## Problem 5

A point is chosen at random on a line segment of length $L$. Interpret this statement, and find the probability that the ratio of the shorter to the longer segment is less than $\frac{1}{4}$.


## Problem 6

Consider $X\sim\textrm{Gamma}(\alpha,\,\beta)$.

a.  Find $M_X(t)$, the mgf of $X$. For what values of $t$ is it defined?
b.  Use the moment-generating function to compute $E(X)$.
c.  Use the moment-generating function to compute $\text{var}(X)$.
d.  If $c>0$, what is the distribution of $Y=cX$?

## Problem 7

Here is the cdf of an absolutely continuous random variable $X$:

$$
F(x;\,\alpha,\,\theta)
=
\begin{cases}
1-\left(\frac{\theta}{x + \theta}\right)^\alpha & x >0 \\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$

The parameters $\alpha$ and $\theta$ are just positive constants.

-   Find the pdf of $X$ and plot it for $\alpha=1\com 2\com 3$ and $\theta = 1$.
-   Compute $E(X)$. Is it finite for all values of the parameters?
-   Compute $\textrm{var}(X)$. Is it finite for all values of the parameters?
-   How does $\alpha$ affect the shape of the pdf? How is this related to the moments?
-   Fix $(\alpha\com\theta) = (3\com 100)$ and compute $P(X > 75\given X > 50)$.



## Problem 8

Here is the pdf of some random variable:

$$
f(x;\,a,\, b)=\begin{cases}
ax^2e^{-bx^2} & x\geq 0\\
0 & x< 0.
\end{cases}
$$

Solve for $a$ in terms of $b$. Your final answer should be a simple formula with a bunch of constants. So no unevaluated integrals.


## Problem 6

Let $X\sim\textrm{Exponential}(\lambda)$.

a.  Compute the quantile function of $X$.
b.  Compute $\textrm{median}(X)$.
